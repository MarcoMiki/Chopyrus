# Chopyrus
Chorus library for the ThirdLight Chorus API. It requires an active Chorus subscription and the API module to be used.

Not all API methods are included here, but enough to help most use cases. 

# Usage

Initialising the class requires an API key and a site URL which you can retrieve from your Chorus site. Note that the API key should be generated from the "admin" menu and will not be specific for a particular user. 

This means that all methods in this library relate to the site itself. You won't find methods to get a specific user's contexts or perform actions as that user.

#Methods

this is where I will document my methods (I promise!)
